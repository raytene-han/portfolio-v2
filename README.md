# Portfolio v2

## Fully Responsive Portfolio Website
My second attempt at building a portfolio website, this time built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Also featuring:
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- [React Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll)
